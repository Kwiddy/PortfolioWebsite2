**Running the program**:
- From the highest level of the coursework, i.e. outside of the public folder, run *npm start*. You may first need to run *npm install* to download the correct node_modules.
- The server should now be running on port 8888
- On a browser of your choice (tested on Google chrome) navigate to:
    http://localhost:8888/

**Camera Movements:**
- To rotate the camera around the scene, use the 
arrow keys
- To move the camera around the scene along the axis, use W, A, S, and D
- To zoom into the scene, use Z, and to zoom out of the screen, use X.

**Lighting Controls:**
- To increase the general scene lighting, use L, note that the initial lighting used is set to maximum. To decrease the general scene lighting, use K, to a limit of 0.
- To increase the lamp lighting, initially set to 0, use M, to decrease it again, use N.

**Animations:**
- Press C to set the table, this pulls out the four chairs, draws plates and cutlery, and lays them on the table. Pressing C again will remove these plates and return the chairs.
- Press P to move the pouffe to the other side of the sofa, and again to move back again.
- Press T to turn on the television. A remote will slide out from beneath the TV and rotate in the air, after which the TV display will change.

**The Scene:**
- The scene has 15 objects where 11 are animated. These animated objects are: 4 chairs, 1 pouffe, 1 TV, 1 TV remote, 4 plates & cutlery. The objects not animated include: 1 lamp, 1 table, 1 sofa, 1 TV stand. 

**External Resources Adopted**:
- In the creation of my program I have used no external modelling software nor have I used any external libraries. 
- I have used several general textures which can be found in *public/textures/*. These are sample textures for the program and are very simplistic, themselves and alternatives can easily be found on *Google Images*. The only non-simple texture is for the TV screen when activated which displayes a logo from *BBC News*.
- When developing the program, I used several forums and youtube videos for teaching myself appropriate methods, and build upon the methods demonstrated in several of the module's practicals.
